 * This class is used to store promises against an incrementing integer so that the
 * promise can be resolved from outside the context of the original block.
 *
 * An example of this is when React needs to request asynchronous data from a Native
 * UI Component. Communication to UI components across the React Native bridge is
 * limited to 1-way, so the value must be emitted afterwards using an event which is
 * not immediately available to the original JavaScript method. So to get around this
 * limitation, we empower the React event subscription to resolve the promise.
